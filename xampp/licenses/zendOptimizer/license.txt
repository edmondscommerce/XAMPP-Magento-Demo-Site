Licensor relating to this Agreement, whether via online forms or otherwise, is accurate and complete and that the person 
Accepting the terms hereof is authorized to bind to this Agreement the entity identified by it as the licensee under this 
Agreement. IF THE SOFTWARE DOWNLOADED OR INSTALLED HEREUNDER IS DESIGNATED BY LICENSOR AS A "BETA 
VERSION," LICENSEE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH SOFTWARE IS A BETA VERSION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN 
COMPLETELY TESTED BY LICENSOR. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, REGARDLESS OF HOW THE SOFTWARE IS 
DESIGNATED BY LICENSOR (E.G. AS A "BETA VERSION" OR OTHERWISE), THE SOFTWARE IS BEING LICENSED HEREUNDER 
WITH NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ITS USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT ITS OWN RISK. THE 
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED SOLELY ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. LICENSOR AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE, AND LICENSEE RECEIVES, 
NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE. LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND/OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

OTHERWISE OBTAINING SUCH OTHER SOFTWARE OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PHP.

OF SUCH DAMAGES) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND UNDER 
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OR LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS 
MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL LICENSOR'S 
TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING HEREUNDER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EXCEED THE SUM OF $100. 

7. INDEMNITY 
Licensee will, at its own expense, defend any action brought by a third party against Licensor to the extent that such action is 
based on a claim arising from or relating to: (a) Licensee's use of the Software, (ii) any distribution of the Software by 
Licensee or by any Licensee Customer or by any sublicensee or extended sublicensee of any such Licensee Customer, 
regardless of privity of contract and regardless of the length of the trail of sublicenses, or (iii) any use of the Software by any 
of the foregoing sublicensees. Licensor shall have the exclusive right to control such defense. In no event shall Licensee settle 
any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding in any manner that materially prejudices Licensor's rights without Licensor's prior 
written approval. 

8. CONFIDENTIALITY 
8.1. Confidential Information. Licensee shall (and shall ensure that its employees shall) maintain the strict confidentiality of 
the Software, all information and materials contained in the Software and all information and materials conveyed by Licensor 
to Licensee hereunder, including but not limited to documentation that may be provided with the Software, or any other 
information relating to the Software's features and modes of operation, inventions (whether or not patentable), techniques, 
processes, algorithms, schematics, testing procedures, software design and architecture, computer code, internal 
documentation, design and function specifications, analysis and performance information, user documentation and other 
technical information, plans and data (collectively, the "Licensor Proprietary Information"). This undertaking shall not apply to

party or use the Licensor Proprietary Information other than as authorized hereunder. Furthermore, Licensee: (a) recognizes 
that the unauthorized use or disclosure of Licensor Proprietary Information will give rise to irreparable injury to Licensor or its 
licensors for which monetary damages may be an inadequate remedy; and (b) agrees that Licensor or its licensors may seek 
and obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of Licensee's obligations under this Agreement, in addition 
to any other legal and equitable remedies which may be available to Licensor.

functionality of the Software) from the United States to (i) any country destination to which export is restricted by the Export 
Administration Regulations of the United States Department of Commerce; (ii) any country subject to sanctions administered 
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, United States Department of the Treasury; or (iii) such other countries to which export

11. MISCELLANEOUS 
This Agreement and any matters relating to it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the country 
of Israel, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws, and the sole venue and jurisdiction for any disputes arising out of or 
related to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof shall be the appropriate courts located in the country of Israel and 
Licensee consents to the jurisdiction of such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor shall have the right to apply to 
any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or other relief. Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Licensee 
shall not sublicense, assign, delegate or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of the related rights or obligations for any 
reason and any attempt by Licensee to sublicense, assign, delegate or transfer this Agreement or any of the related rights or 
obligations hereunder shall cause the immediate termination of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the complete and 
exclusive statement of the terms and agreement between Licensor and Licensee and supersedes all prior representations, 
understandings and communications, oral or written, between the parties with respect thereto, including memoranda of 
agreement. The failure of Licensor to insist, in any one or more instances, upon the performance of any term or terms of this 
Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of its rights to such performance or future performance of 
such a term or terms, and the obligation of Licensee in respect thereto shall continue in full force and effect. In the event that 
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision or portion of a provision of this Agreement is invalid, unlawful, 
or unenforceable to any extent, the parties agree that such provision shall be deemed to be modified to the minimal extent 
necessary to make such provision enforceable while still retaining the intent of the parties. In such event, the remainder of 
this Agreement and its application to other persons shall not be affected thereby, and such remaining provisions of this 
Agreement shall continue to be valid and may be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the event legal action is 
taken by Licensor or its licensors to enforce any provision of this Agreement, all costs and expenses, including reasonable 
attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by Licensor or its licensors shall be paid by Licensee, in addition to other damages to 
which Licensor or its licensors may be lawfully entitled. This Agreement shall be subject to modification or amendment only by 
written instrument duly executed by authorized representatives of both parties. Licensee agrees that it will not refer to the 
Software or to the existence of this Agreement nor will it use Licensor's name in any press releases, advertising, marketing or 
other materials without Licensor's advanced written consent in each instance. Any notice provided by Licensee to Licensor 
pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing to Zend Technologies Ltd. at P.O. Box 3619, Ramat Gan 52136, Israel, and shall 
be deemed given (i) if by hand delivery, upon receipt thereof; (ii) if mailed, three (3) days after deposit in the U.S. mails, 
postage prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested; or (iii) if by next day delivery service, upon such delivery. Any notice
